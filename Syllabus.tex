\item (-$\infty$, 60) = F
\end{itemize}


\section*{Exams}
All exams will be take home exams.  

\section*{Homework}
Homework is due approximately every other week. Discussion between classmates is encouraged; however, the final work should be independent.  Homework must be submitted through Sakai.  \\

Homework turned in after the due date will receive no credit.  To help your final grade, please do avoid late homework.\\

\section*{Project}
The individual project will require students to find a raw data set, wrangle the data into a useful format, perform some interesting analysis, and present results in a written report following the principles of reproducible research.  All code must be version controlled through github (or repository of your choice) and a link to the repository must be submitted along with the final report.  The project is due the same day as the scheduled final exam, which is Saturday, May 6, 2023.  \\

\begin{itemize}
\item Make-up policy: Missed Exams:  No make-up exams will be given. If you miss one exam and have a valid and verifiable personal or medical excuse (such as an illness requiring hospitalization or a death in the immediate family), your final exam score will be pro-rated to make up the missing points. All medical excuses must be signed by your physician. Original documents must be shown to the instructor; no photocopied or scanned documents will be accepted. Students who do not provide appropriate documentation for missing an exam will receive a zero on the exam. No more than one exam may be missed. Please note that vacations and travel plans are not valid reasons for missing an exam.

\item Academic Dishonesty: Many practice problems will be given to be worked on outside of class; discussing practice problems with others is encouraged and in-class discussions are also encouraged. It is presumed and required that students do their own work on the exams. Cheating includes, but is not limited to, illegal collaboration, copying, using materials not permitted, and assisting others on tests. Anyone found cheating will not be permitted to withdraw and will receive an F grade for the course. Your academic dean will be informed and a statement will be placed in your permanent file.\\
